Two int variables, euroSales and asiaSales, have already been declared and initialized. Another int variable, eurasiaSales, has already been declared.

Write a statement that calls add to compute the sum of euroSales and asiaSales and that stores this value in eurasiaSales.

Assume that add is defined in the same class that calls it.
