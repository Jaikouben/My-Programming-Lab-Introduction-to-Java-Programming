/*
max is a method that accepts two int arguments and returns the value of the larger one.

Four int variables, population1, population2, population3, and population4 have already been declared and initialized.

Write an expression (not a statement!) whose value is the largest of population1, population2, population3, and population4 by calling max.

Assume that max is defined in the same class that calls it.
