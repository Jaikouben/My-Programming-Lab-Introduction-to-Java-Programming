/*
Assume that x is a variable that has been declared as an int and been given a value. Assume that oneMore is a function that receives a single integer parameter and returns a value that is one greater than its argument. (So if you pass 7 to oneMore it will return 8. Thus, the expression oneMore(9) has the value 10.

Write an expression whose value is four more than x without using the standard Java arithmetic operators (*,+, etc.). Instead, use calls to oneMore to accomplish this.

In this exercise you must write this as a single expression-- you must not write any statements. Also, you may only use the oneMore function-- no other functions or operators.
