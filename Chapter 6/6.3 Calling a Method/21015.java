/*
Assume that x is a variable that has been declared as an int and been given a value. Assume that twice is a method (in the same class as the caller) that receives a single integer parameter and returns twice its value. (So if you pass 7 to twice it will return 14. Thus the expression twice(7) has the value 14.

Write an expression whose value is eight times that of x without using the standard Java arithmetic operators (*,+, etc.). Instead, use calls to twice to accomplish this.

In this exercise you must write this as a single expression-- you must not write any statements. Also, you may only use the twice() function-- no other functions or operators.
