Assume that name has been declared suitably for storing names (like "Misha", "Emily" and "Sofia"). Assume also that stdin is a variable that references a Scanner object associated with standard input Write some code that reads a value into name then prints the message "Greetings, NAME" on a line by itself, where NAME is replaced the value that was read into name. For example, if your code read in "Rachel" it would print out "Greetings, Rachel" on a line by itself.
