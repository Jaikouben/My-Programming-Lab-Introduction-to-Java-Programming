/*
Given three String variables that have been declared and given values, gold, silver, and bronze, write an expression whose value is the values of each these variables joined by a newline character. So if gold, silver, and bronze, had the values "Arakawa", "Cohen", and "Slutskaya", the expression, if it were printed would have the names "Arakawa", "Cohen", and "Slutskaya" each appearing on a separate line. (Do NOT print anything in this exercise: just write the expression.)
