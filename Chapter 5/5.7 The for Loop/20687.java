/*
Assume the int variables i,lo, hi, and result have been declared and that lo and hi have been initialized. Assume further that result has been initialized to the value 0.

Write a for loop that adds the integers from lo up through hi (inclusive), and stores the result in result.

Your code should not change the values of lo and hi. Also, do not declare any additional variables -- use only i,lo, hi, and result.
